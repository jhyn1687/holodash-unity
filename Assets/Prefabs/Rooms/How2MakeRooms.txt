# How to Make Rooms

1. Have Room scene open, drag RoomBase into Grid
2. Each room needs 1 of each; make sure it has these:
- RoomInfo prefab
- Endzone prefab

3. Draw level with the Tile Palette, edit in scene.
4. Add any FallthroughPlatform's you want
5. In RoomInfoPositions tilemap, draw enemies and coins. Use the "Instanceables" tile palette, IN SCENE. IMPORTANT: Place the END marker at the exit.
6. Place the Endzone at the same position as the END marker. Its offset compensates for this
7. Rename the prefab, drag it to the folder to make it as an original prefab.
