# HoloDash Unity Git Tracker

## Getting Started

Install [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) just in case.

>git lfs install

## Unity

Create a project with 2D (URP), then git clone the folders into the project. Or git clone somewhere else and copy the folders in. (Let me know which one works, I haven't tested yet.)

## What's in this "base"?

Basic movement, physics, dashing, and a basic tile map.

Things that you can change (and their default values) inside of the unity editor:

```
numJumps = 1
horizontalSpeed = 5
jumpVelocity = 5
dashVelocity = 10
```

## Make a branch and add stuff!
