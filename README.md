# HoloDash Unity Git Tracker

## Getting Started

Install [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) just in case.

>git lfs install

## Unity

Create a project with 2D (URP), then git clone the folders into the project. Or git clone somewhere else and copy the folders in. (Let me know which one works, I haven't tested yet.)

## What's in this "base"?

* Basic movement, physics, dashing
* A basic tile palette.
* Player sprite w/ animation
* Basic weapon shooting
* Enemies with HP, basic sprite.

## Make a branch and add stuff!
